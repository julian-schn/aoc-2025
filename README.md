# Advent of Code 2025
This repo is home to my attempts at the AoC challenges 2025, I'm not very good at data structures and algorithms, so this will be a fun challenge

## Spoilers ahead!!
This will have my (working, fingers crossed) submissions, they may spoil your fun

## Learnings
### Day 02
- **String Algorithms**: Investigated Pattern Matching (LZ77, Suffix Trees) and Rolling Hash (Rabin-Karp) for complex sequence analysis.

### Day 03
- **Sliding Window**: Applied sliding window technique for efficient linear scanning and data processing.

### Day 07
- **Memoization / DP**: Implemented recursive DFS with memoization to optimize path counting.

### Day 08
- **Union-Find (DSU)**: Utilized Disjoint Set Union (Kruskal's algorithm) to identify connected components efficiently.

### Day 09
- **Computational Geometry**: Applied Ray Casting algorithm and rectangle intersection logic for point-in-polygon containment.
