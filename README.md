# Advent of Code 2025
This repo is home to my attempts at the AoC challenges 2025, I'm not very good at data structures and algorithms, so this will be a fun challenge

## Spoilers ahead!!
This will have my (working, fingers crossed) submissions, they may spoil your fun

## Learnings
### Day 02
- In part two of the problem, I started thinking about pattern finding algorithms, and decided after brief thinking and coming to the conclusion that brute forcing would lead to insane time complexity, I would like to implement an existing algorithm
- The [CS Stackexchange forum](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/79182/im-looking-for-an-algorithm-to-find-unknown-patterns-in-a-string) swiftly pointed me towards things such as LZ77 algorithms, suffix trees and suffix sorting. Funnily enough just yesterday in my heading I wrote not knowing about data structures and algorithms!
- Also something about Rabin-Karp algorithms for a Hash/Sliding Window approach which I didn't implement but check out

### Day 03
- Part two required another window, it is actually quite intuitive once you wrap your head around the principle
- I am still wrestling with the Go syntax and philosophy, coming from Java. A lot of the VSC autocomplete is actually a huge bother trying to learn the language.
- I've been using Google Gemini's learning mode to loop over my mental models (don't worry, I do think of the solution myself and then do need an embrassasing amount of ~~Googling~~StartPaging to actually implement it) and receive feedback. The way it goes back and forth with you asking control questions is really quite helpful, it made me trace my algorithm in p1 by hand for example

## Day 07
- Hashes, and such

## Day 08
- Union-Find
