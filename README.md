# Advent of Code 2025
This repo is home to my attempts at the AoC challenges 2025, I'm not very good at data structures and algorithms, so this will be a fun challenge

## Spoilers ahead!!
This will have my (working, fingers crossed) submissions, they may spoil your fun

## Learnings
### Day 02
- In part two of the problem, I started thinking about pattern finding algorithms, and decided after brief thinking and coming to the conclusion that brute forcing would lead to insane time complexity, I would like to implement an existing algorithm
- The [CS Stackexchange forum](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/79182/im-looking-for-an-algorithm-to-find-unknown-patterns-in-a-string) swiftly pointed me towards things such as LZ77 algorithms, suffix trees and suffix sorting. Funnily enough just yesterday in my heading I wrote not knowing about data structures and algorithms!
